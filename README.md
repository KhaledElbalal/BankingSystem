## Programming Language
This project was developed using Python 3.11 for its versatility and wide range of applications. The Eel library was employed to develop the Graphical User Interface (GUI), incorporating HTML, CSS, JS, and TailwindCSS for a modern and responsive design. Additionally, Matplotlib was used to generate reports. The app uses an Azure database so no configuration is needed for the Database part, just installing the ODBC drivers. The Connection doesn’t commit the changes by intention, the DB “resets” when the program restarts.
